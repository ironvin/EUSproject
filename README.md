# EUS project

To access the project, download the zip file in the repo. It has everything and should require the most minimal setup. You can view the source code through this repo directly.

### Zip file download link: [EnergyUsageSystem.zip](https://github.com/ironvin/EUSproject/blob/main/EnergyUsageSystem.zip)

After downloading the zip file, you can build the entire project manually in Visual Studio, but it's recommended to use the executable binary already made. It's found here:

> `bin\Debug\net8.0\EnergyUsageSystem.exe`

(Contrary to how it seems, the executable is **not** a debug build. It's perfectly fine as the release build.)

#### Here are the usernames and passwords for the program:

| User | Password |
| :--- | :--- |
| Administrator | SuperCoolBuilding123 |
| Manager | ManagerPassword123 |

The user manual can help you to understand how to use the program. It's reliable for surface-level understanding only, though.

#### If any issues should arise, please contact me or our team directly.
